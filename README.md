👋 Hi, I’m @sprrwDE, a freelance designer and developer from Germany with a background in digital marketing.
👀 I’m interested in web development, especially web animations.
🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and TypeScript, and I’m also exploring backend technologies.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects with high learning potential.
📫 You can reach me via email at info@sparrowmedia.de.
😄 Hobbies: Playing guitar and chess, doing sports and outdoor-stuff, and sometimes also gaming.
⚡ Fun fact: I can juggle! My spirit animal is an otter because otter-life means keeping your head slightly over the water
