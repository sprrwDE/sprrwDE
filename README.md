Hi, Iâ€™m @sprrwDE, a freelance designer and developer from Germany with a background in digital marketing. Iâ€™m super passionate about web development, especially web animations â€“ thatâ€™s where I truly come alive! Right now, Iâ€™m diving into Angular and TypeScript, while also exploring the world of backend technologies.

Iâ€™m always on the lookout for exciting projects that are not just fun but also offer a steep learning curve. If youâ€™ve got something cool in the works, let me know! The best way to reach me is via email at info@sparrowmedia.de.

In my free time, I love playing guitar, challenging someone to a game of chess, staying active with sports, or enjoying outdoor adventures. Occasionally, Iâ€™ll also indulge in a gaming session. Fun fact: I can juggle! And my spirit animal? Definitely an otter, because otters always manage to keep their heads above water â€“ just like me. ðŸ˜‰

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re up for collaborating on something awesome!
