Hi, I’m Kai, a freelance designer and developer from Germany with a background in digital marketing. I’m super passionate about web development, especially web animations. Right now, I’m diving into Angular and TypeScript, while also exploring the world of backend technologies.

I’m always on the lookout for exciting projects that are not just fun but also offer a steep learning curve. If you’ve got something cool in the works, let me know! The best way to reach me is via email at info@sparrowmedia.de.

In my free time, I love playing guitar, challenging someone to a game of chess, staying active with sports, or enjoying outdoor adventures. Occasionally, I’ll also indulge in a gaming session. Fun fact: I can juggle! 
My spirit animal must be otter because otter-life means keeping your head just above the water :D

Let’s connect if you’re up for collaborating on something awesome!
